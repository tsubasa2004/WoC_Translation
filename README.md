# Introduction
Translation scripts for [World of Cultivation](https://wwyxhqc.wordpress.com/%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-world-of-cultivation/).  WoC's translation is somewhat infamous for overwhelming the reader with Chinese words.  The first few chapters aren't representative, though — the frequency dies down quickly, and few new words are introduced after the first five-ish chapters.  These scripts should be complete through the first 30 chapters, and hit the vast majority of terms for the remainder of the current translation.

# The scripts

[WoC Mouseover Translations.user.js](https://github.com/tsubasa2004/WoC_Translation/blob/master/WoC%20Mouseover%20Translations.user.js) adds a tooltip to Chinese words with a translation or conversion.

[WoC Direct Translations.user.js](https://github.com/tsubasa2004/WoC_Translation/blob/master/WoC%20Direct%20Translations.user.js) replaces most words with the English translations.  This can be somewhat awkward, particularly where it comes to subject/verb agreement or word order.  Some terms (units; words with no succint English equivalent) have been left in Pinyin with mouseover translation.

# Regarding the translation

I attempted my own MTL of the first 7 chapters of WoC, and I found myself agreeing more with the Dreams of Jianghu translation than I thought I would.

*Ling* could be directly translated as 'spirit'; but the word gets used as many as three times in a sentence.  An English word would start to sound weird very quickly.  There's also ~3 other terms which would normally be "spirit something", so it's definitely an overloaded word.  

I chose to translate *Jie* as "continent".  Normally it'd be a political division—country, kingdom, maybe province—but they don't seem to actually have a government.  They're just big landmasses, surrounded by water.

The honorifics are really dumped on the reader (and admittedly, they're pretty samey-sounding), but they're not actually worse than Japanese honorifics, just less familiar to the average reader.  The martial honorifics are analagous to a family structure - your master is your martial father, his master is your martial grandfather; fellow disciples are martial sisters and brothers, your master's martial brothers are your martial uncles, etc.

I have left the Chinese units in place; actually converting them would be a pain.  Also, you are never going to need to know exact numbers.

The levels of cultivation needed to be translated; no excuses there.
